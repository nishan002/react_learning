Same Element Reference 

In React, when a parent component renders, React will recursively render all of its child components.

"Unecessary renders" where the child component goes through the render phase but not the commit phase.

You can extract the expensive child component and instead pass it down as props to the parent component.

Whenever there is a re-render caused by a change in the state of the parent component, React will optimize the re-render for you by knowing that the props has to be referencing the same element before and after the render.


React Memo

In react, when a parent component renders, a child component might unnecessarily render.

To optimize this behavious, you can use React.memo and pass in the Child component.

React.memo will perform a shallow comparison of the previous and new props and re-render the child only if he props have changed.



Incorrect optimization of React.memo

1. if Child component has its own children components.

2. if changes on the state of the Parent Component need to show in the Child Component

3. If there is any object, array or function it will always create new reference while Parent component re-render.
