useState and Render 

1. The setter function from a useState hook will cause the component re-render 
2. The exception is when you update a State Hook to the same value as the current state 
3. Same value after the initial render ? The component will not re-render 
4. Same value after re-render ? React will render that specific component one more time then bail out from any subsequent render.
